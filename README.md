First Hackathon -ATTHack Women in Tech Hack

This is an application for the Vuzix M100 Smart Glass. It consists of a voice recognition feature--the word "halt" triggers the camera app to run and automatically take a picture which is thus stored in the Android Cloud Service. This idea was primarily inspired by the numerous cases of harassament that women face. One of the benefits of using a wearable device is that it allows you to be hands-free as opposed to using your cell-phone to take a picture for instance. In addition, it allows for a fast reaction in any given emergency situation. Also, the automatic storage of the data linked to the voice recognition lets the users catch the perpetrator in a more efficient and quick manner.

Further expansions:
-Implement a gps system--when the word "halt" is recognized, it stores your location and (with the use of the AT&T api) automatically send a SMS to your emergency contact the location if help is needed.
